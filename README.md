# FakeTinder
During my programming bootcamp, on the day we were introduced to HTML and CSS, I was challenged to develop a fake Tinder account for one of my colleagues. 

Fake Tinder served as a practical playground to develop HTML and CSS skills. By building the structure, using HTML, and then styling it with CSS, I honed my understanding of web development fundamentals.
I also had the chance to be introduced to Bootstrap.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience of HTML and CSS concepts, offering a tangible application of what I've been learning in the bootcamp.
